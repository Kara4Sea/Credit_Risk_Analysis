# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to create machine learning models to evaluate the credit risk to understand which applicants are good candidates for a line of credit. During analysis, I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate resampling models. Then I also oversampled the data with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms. I also used BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to compare machine learning models in reducing bias to understand a more accurate prediction of credit risk. This provides me with the information I need to evaluate the performance of models utilized.
